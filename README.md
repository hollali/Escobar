User Authentication System

This C++ code implements a simple user authentication system with options for login, registration, and password recovery. User credentials are stored in a text file named database.txt. The program provides a console-based interface for users to interact with the system.
Features

    Login: Users can log in with their username and password.

    Registration: New users can register by providing a username and password. The registration information is appended to the database.txt file.

    Password Recovery: Users can recover their account information either by searching for their account using the username or by searching for their account using the password.

    Simple Menu Interface: Users are presented with a menu to choose their desired action.

Usage

    Compile and run the C++ program.
    Choose an option from the menu:
        Login: Enter your username and password to log in.
        Register: Provide a username and password for registration.
        Forgot Credentials: Recover your account information by searching with either the username or password.
        Exit: Terminate the program.

Important Note

    This program uses a simple text file (database.txt) to store user credentials. In a real-world scenario, a more secure and scalable database system would be preferred.
